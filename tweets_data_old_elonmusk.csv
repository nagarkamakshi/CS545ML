5/1/2016,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
5/1/2016,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
5/1/2016,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
5/1/2016,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
5/1/2016,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
5/1/2016,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
